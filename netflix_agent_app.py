Your task:
- Write a short, conversational explanation (~3\u20135 sentences) of **why this movie fits their request**
- Start with: \"We chose this film because you asked for: '...'\"
- If the match is not perfect, say so honestly
- If the movie lacks a specific genre/mood the user asked for, gently explain that too
- Emphasize age-appropriateness if it's a good fit
- End with something warm like \"We think you\u2019ll enjoy it!\"

Avoid pretending it's a perfect fit if it\u2019s not. Be smart, transparent, and helpful.
